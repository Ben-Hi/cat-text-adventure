# cat-text-adventure
Cpp project. Text based adventure game utilizing object oriented programming.

This project was completed in December 2019. The challenge was to use a data structure to create a 
text based adventure game where the user could maneuver between rooms and complete tasks. A time limit was
required along with win and fail states. 

A linked list was used to establish the map of the game, allowing the player to move between rooms in their 
house and along the road outside. The player can fail the game by using up all of their time units or by
choosing the incorrect reaction to scripted events that occur along the player's journey. The player can win
by finding the correct items and using them to catch their cat. 

The initial prototype of the game was constructed entirely within Vim. This version was edited and revised 
using Visual Studio Code. This was the first time I had used VS Code in a project and I had a great amount 
of trouble figuring out how to compile my code and how to get a Makefile to work. I found that using VS
Code allowed me to have a faster workflow overall and reduced the number of errors and bugs I introduced
due to improper syntax or spelling errors. Access to documentation through keyboard shortcuts also helped
me find better solutions to problems that had stumped me in Vim.
